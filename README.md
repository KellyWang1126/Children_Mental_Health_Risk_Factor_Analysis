# Youth Mental Health Risk Factor Analysis
Analyzing risk factors is important in preventing mental health issues among young individuals. This project aims to prioritize features associated with youth mental health symptoms. Utilizing data from phases 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.10 of the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) dataset, we trained models via the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Following this, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to determine the ranking of these features. Our findings revealed that the proportion of children in the household was the most significant variable, while tenure status and state of residence were the least significant variables.
